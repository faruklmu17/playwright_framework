#### Review & Suggestions

1. **Step-by-step clarity**  
   - Each major section (Installation, Quickstart, Structure, Capabilities) is clearly delineated with headings and separators.  
   - The numbered and bulleted lists guide readers smoothly through setup and usage.

2. **Consistency**  
   - Ensure code blocks use proper indentation (the YAML snippet had an extra stray “n” before `run:`—removed above).  
   - Use consistent punctuation after list items (either all ending with a period or none).

3. **Readability**  
   - Consider adding brief one-line intros above code snippets (e.g. “Copy/paste this JSON into your `package.json`…”).  
   - For the “Project Structure” tree, align comments and add a blank line before and after the block for breathing space.

4. **Actionable examples**  
   - You may want to include a very minimal “example.spec.ts” in the Quickstart or link to `src/tests/basic.spec.ts` so users can see a complete test file.

5. **Typos & formatting**  
   - Verified headings and badges—no typos found.  
   - All code blocks now render correctly.

Overall, the README is concise, well-organized, and easy to follow. Let me know if you’d like to tweak any section further or add an inline example test!
